## Project Tasks

### 1. Project Understanding
- My role was defined as a **Data Analyst**.
- I was introduced to **Social Buzz** through a briefing file, followed by a knowledge-check quiz.
- I received an **Accenture Project Team** document and completed another quiz based on its details.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Modelling
- I worked with **3 different datasets**, each containing unique columns and values.
- I received a **data model** that outlined the relationships between datasets.
- The steps followed:
  1. **Requirements gathering**: Understanding business questions and required data.
  2. **Data cleaning**: Merging and transforming datasets for analysis.
  3. **Data modeling**: Structuring data to enable meaningful insights.

#### Data Cleaning Task:
- **Merging three datasets** to create a final dataset using the `Reaction` table as the base.
- Using **VLOOKUP** to merge relevant columns from the `Content` and `Reaction Types` datasets.
- Identifying the **Top 5 Performing Categories** using Pivot Tables.
- The final dataset contains:
  - A **cleaned dataset**
  - A **list of the top 5 content categories**

### 3. Data Analysis and Insights

I conducted various analyses to uncover key insights, including:

- **Number of Unique Categories**: `16`
- **Least Reactions for a Post**: `Veganism` category with `1,328` reactions
- **Month with the Most Posts**: `May`
- **Top 5 Categories Based on Total Scores**:
  1. **Animals** (`~75K` engagement score)
  2. **Science** (`~71K` engagement score)
  3. **Technology**
  4. **Food**
  5. **Healthy Eating**

### 4. Presentation and Storytelling
- I created a **PowerPoint presentation** summarizing my analysis.
- Key takeaways from the presentation:
  - **Animals** and **Science** dominate post counts and engagement.
  - **Food** and **Healthy Eating** show lower engagement, indicating opportunities for improvement.
  - Recommended strategies for **maintaining top-performing categories** and **enhancing underperforming content**.
- I recorded a **video presentation** to communicate findings effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel** (for data cleaning and modeling)
- **Power BI** (for visualization and dashboard creation)
- **PowerPoint** (for presentation)

## Results and Key Insights
The project provided actionable insights for Social Buzz:
- **Optimize content strategy** for high-engagement categories.
- **Improve visibility** and interaction for underperforming content.
- **Data-driven decision making** to enhance content performance and user engagement.
